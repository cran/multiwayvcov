Description: Exports two functions implementing
    multi-way clustering using the method suggested by Cameron, Gelbach, &
    Miller (2011) and cluster (or block)
    bootstrapping for estimating variance-covariance matrices. Normal one and
    two-way clustering matches the results of other common statistical
    packages.  Missing values are handled transparently and rudimentary
    parallelization support is provided.
